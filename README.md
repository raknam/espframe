</p>

Built with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) on the ESP32-P4, the frame connects directly to your Immich server over HTTP and streams photos to your display, completely in private over your local network.

## Features

- **Fully standalone** — runs on bare hardware, no hub or cloud service needed
- **Smart portrait pairing** — detects portrait photos and pairs them side-by-side from the same day
- **Accent colour fill** — letterboxed areas are tinted with a colour sampled from the photo
- **Configuration options** — change Immich URL, API key, slideshow interval, and more via the built-in web UI
