# Espframe for Immich

A standalone digital photo frame that displays your [Immich](https://immich.app/) photo library on a Guition ESP32-P4 touchscreen — no additional services required.

</p>

Built with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) on the ESP32-P4, the frame connects directly to your Immich server over HTTP or HTTPS and streams photos to your display, completely in private over your local network.

## Features

- **Fully standalone** — runs on bare hardware, no hub or cloud service needed
- **Photo sources** — show all photos, favourites, specific albums, specific people, "on this day" memories, or date-filtered ranges
- **Display tone adjustment** — adjust colour temperature (e.g. warm the image if the panel looks too blue)
- **Night tone** — automatically adjust screen tone between sunset and sunrise
- **Screen scheduling** — schedule when to turn off the display; set daytime and night-time brightness separately
- **Smart portrait pairing** — detects portrait photos and pairs them side-by-side from the same day
- **Accent colour fill** — letterboxed areas are tinted with a colour sampled from the photo
- **Configuration options** — change Immich URL, API key, photo source, date filters, slideshow interval, and more via the built-in web UI
