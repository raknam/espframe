# Install

Flash Espframe to a supported Guition ESP32-P4 display from your browser — no desktop toolchain or ESPHome required.

## What You'll Need

- **Supported Guition ESP32-P4 display**, **USB-C cable** (data-capable), **Immich server** on your network ([immich.app](https://immich.app/)), and an [**Immich API key**](./api-key)

| Model | Panel | Stand |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Guition ESP32-P4 10" `JC8012P4A1` | [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c4LLo3rH) | [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2490049-guition-p4-10inch-screen-stand#profileId-2736046) |
| Guition ESP32-P4 7" `JC1060P470` | [AliExpress](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_c335W0r5) | [MakerWorld](https://makerworld.com/en/models/2387421-guition-esp32p4-jc1060p470-7inch-screen-desk-mount#profileId-2614995) |

## Connect the Display

The device has two USB-C ports. Plug the cable into the **bottom port** (labeled **USB** on the PCB) — the one closest to the edge, next to the USB-A connector. The upper port is for the screen ribbon cable only.

::: tip Wrong port?
If flashing fails, make sure you're using the **bottom** USB-C port as shown above. The upper port will not work for flashing.

## Web Installer

Connect the display via USB-C, choose the matching model, then click the install button below. Choosing the wrong model can flash firmware for the wrong screen size, so check the model printed in the listing or on the PCB before continuing.

## Steps

1. **Connect** — Plug in with USB-C; allow drivers if prompted.
2. **Flash** — Click **Install Espframe for Immich**, choose the device’s serial port, confirm. Takes a few minutes.
3. **WiFi** — Enter network name and password when prompted. If no prompt appears, the device creates a hotspot named for the selected model, such as **immich-frame-10inch** or **immich-frame-7inch**; connect from phone/laptop for captive-portal setup.
4. **Immich** — Open the device IP in a browser (shown on screen), enter **Immich server URL** and **API key**. See [API Key](/api-key) for permissions. Photos start loading. Next: [Photo Sources](/photo-sources) to choose what to display.

## Recent firmware notes

- **Multiple Person or Album IDs:** Saving comma-separated UUID lists uses a POST body so long lists no longer hit **414 URI Too Long**. Album IDs and Person IDs are still limited to **255 characters** each; see [Photo Sources](/photo-sources#album-and-person-id-limits).
- **Photo date filters:** The web UI now supports fixed date ranges and rolling ranges such as the last 6 months or last 2 years. See [Photo Sources](/photo-sources#date-filtering).
- **ESPHome 2026.4:** Current local builds use ESPHome `2026.4.0`; manual builds also include compatibility fixes for ESPHome 2026.3 and 2026.4 LVGL changes.
